# Why TypeScript

- Superset of JS
- Statically typed
- Makes code more strict
- functions in ts
- Making a calculator

### TypeScript never runs the TS file it only converts the ts file to the js file with the strict mode enabled (using TS compiler)
- it only throws a compilation error

# tsc --init 
- creates a config file to TS - it tells how strict our TS file should be...

- esnext - latest version of JS

- interfaces can be implemented by classes whereas types don't
- type


- interface allows to do unions and ors 
- Types cannot be extended
